\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm where multiple clients collaboratively train a shared global model while keeping their local data private. Instead of transmitting sensitive data to a central server, clients perform local training and share only model updates. This approach has gained significant traction in domains such as healthcare, finance, and mobile applications where data privacy is critical.

Despite these advantages, FL faces critical security challenges that current solutions inadequately address. Malicious clients may submit poisoned updates to compromise model integrity, while untrusted servers may manipulate aggregation processes to favor specific outcomes. Traditional mitigation approaches rely on trust assumptions or statistical anomaly detection, which prove insufficient against sophisticated adversarial attacks.

\textbf{Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)} offer a revolutionary cryptographic solution that enables one party (the prover) to convince another (the verifier) that a computation was performed correctly without revealing sensitive information. In FL contexts, ZKPs enable clients to prove correct local training execution and servers to demonstrate proper aggregation procedures.

\textbf{Our Production Framework} introduces the first comprehensive dual-verifiable federated learning system that combines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Client-side zk-SNARKs}: PySNARK proofs for local training verification
    \item \textbf{Server-side zk-SNARKs}: Efficient Groth16 proofs for aggregation verification
    \item \textbf{FedJSCM Algorithm}: Momentum-based aggregation optimized for non-IID environments
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Proof Rigor}: Adaptive security-performance balancing based on training stability
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Security}: Dynamic proof complexity adjustment based on training dynamics
\end{itemize}

The framework has been extensively validated across 8 diverse datasets with comprehensive performance analysis, demonstrating minimal accuracy impact (0.0\% to -0.2\%) while providing cryptographic security guarantees.

\section{Problem Statement}
Current federated learning systems exhibit several critical limitations that our research addresses:

\textbf{Incomplete Verification}: Most implementations focus solely on client-side verification while ignoring server-side aggregation integrity, creating single points of failure.

\textbf{Static Security Models}: Existing ZKP-based approaches use fixed proof complexity throughout training, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead during stable phases.

\textbf{Limited Scalability}: Previous solutions lack comprehensive multi-dataset validation and performance characterization.

\textbf{Trust Dependencies}: Systems typically assume partial trust in either clients or servers, creating vulnerabilities to coordinated attacks or compromised infrastructure.

\textbf{Performance Overhead}: Existing ZKP implementations impose significant computational and communication costs without adaptive optimization strategies.

\section{Objectives}
The key objectives to be achieved in this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design and implement a dual-verifiable federated learning framework where both clients and the server provide ZKPs using our implemented SecureFlowerClient and SecureFlowerStrategy classes.
    \item Implement zk-SNARK-based proof generation for client-side local training verification using PySNARK integration in our ClientProofManager.
    \item Develop the FedJSCM (Federated Joint Server-Client Momentum) aggregation algorithm with momentum-based parameter updates.
    \item Create a dynamic proof rigor adjustment system with three complexity levels (high, medium, low) through our StabilityMonitor component.
    \item Validate the system performance across multiple datasets demonstrating minimal accuracy degradation.
    \item Demonstrate practical deployment capabilities with efficient proof generation and verification times.
\end{itemize}
